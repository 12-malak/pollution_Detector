# Pollution Detector
## Inspiration

Our team came up with a strategy to tackle the problem of nutrient pollution where 

water bodies such as ponds, seas, lakes and oceans are becoming increasingly hazardous through means of several waste discharge from industries, sewage, agricultural chemicals and house, etc. After many years of research and investigation, it has been found that phosphorus and nitrogen are being contributed in increasing amounts causing Harmful Algal Blooms that pose a serious threat to ecosystem health and integrity.

## What it does

The app measures the nutrient pollution that are present in water, after recording a set of data. It also checks and lets an individual know whether the water is safe or not. 

## How we built it

We had spent five hours while the brainstorming and bringing the innovative ideas that can help in a good sustainable approach for all living beings. Be it any wildlife creature or human, the app facilitates safe use of water for all. We have worked on the frontend and prototype part, and visualized the data with the help of Google Sheets. 

## Challenges we ran into

The major challenge was to get the useful resources. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

The app is proved to be effective, efficient while it also spreads awareness among the individuals. 

## What we learned

We gained an in-depth knowledge about how nutrient pollution can pose death to living beings if they keep using water without analyzing its pollution rate. 

## What's next for Pollution Detector 

Pollution detector will help in creating awareness to a wider scale, which can be implemented globally. It will ensure that water is safe before you bring it to use.
